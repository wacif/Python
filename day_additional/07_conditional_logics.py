# this file is all about conditional logics
# logical operators are either "true or false" "yes or no" "0 or 1"

# equals to                 ==
# not equal to              !=
# less than                 <
# less than or equal to     <=
# greater than              >
# greater than or equal to  >=

# is 19 = 19?
print(19==19)
print(3!=4)
print(5<9)
print(7>44)
# print(19=19) this will give use syntax error

# application of logical operators
